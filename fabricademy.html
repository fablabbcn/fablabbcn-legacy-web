            <p>The textile industry is in need of more humane, ecologically sound and efficient ways of working. We often buy, consume and throw products without any concept of environmental damage. This can be due to a lack of knowledge and education about materials - from the energy consumed in production, labour and waste produced at the end of the cycle. Fabricademy at Fab Lab Barcelona equips students with the skills and knowledge to become key players in an emerging sustainable future of textiles.

            <p>The possibilities to conduct experimental research in an open laboratory give students the physical and mental space for innovative re-thinking and reframing of today's realities, offering the resources for visions to be materialised, tested, developed and fabricated, not as a linear process, but as a spiral iteration and implementation into reality. Through the program, we are developing and implementing a new approach on how to create, produce and distribute textile and fashion elements, by using distributed manufacturing infrastructures and knowledge networks.</p>

          <h2>From 3D-printed shoes to kombucha fabric</h2>
            <p>Previous graduates of Fabricademy have worked on creating and fabricating interactive 3D-printed footwear, biodegradable garments, wearable smart hats, energy-harvesting clothing, whole 3D-printed garments, textile microfactory pilots and more. The projects seek to test, envisage and re-establish our production and consumption models in the context of advanced manufacturing. Through hands-on learning techniques and critical reflection, students develop innovative methodologies and designs which work towards creating a compassionate, sustainable future for the textiles industry. The program collaborates with Eurecat and Reimagine Textile project, in which students have access and training to complete the infrastructure of textile manufacturing facilities and testing machines. Students are mentored by Anastasia Pistofidou, co-founder of Material and Textile research body FabTextiles, Fabricademy and academic director of the global Fabricademy program. With dedicated biomaterial labs, access to two professional Fab Labs and a third lab at Valldaura Campus of IAAC in the Collserola National Park, Fabricademy Barcelona provides an unprecedented experience for students to study in a unique environment. The international IAAC environment welcomes students from 68 countries and over 200 disciplines, which provides all students on campus the opportunity to expand their professional and personal experiences. Alumni of the program have used their future-skills to build leading roles in the global Fab Lab network, established their own design studios and become entrepreneurs in the innovation and new materials fields. </p>

        <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
        <p>We wish to reach all creative disciplines dealing with design and the Maker Movement: creative players, makers, designers, artists, architects, scientists, students and others.

Fashion Designers
For existing fashion designers who are seeking new and innovative ways of working with textiles - whether this is with biomaterials, 3D printed clothing, interactive wearables and more. Fabricademy gives the option for fashion designers to become more sustainable in their practice. 

Designers
We hope to benefit and increase the number of designers and creatives that self-produce goods by integrating resources they don’t have access to. Utilising digital platforms for all aspects of the creation process, to financing and execution.

Makers
This global movement merges artisanal skills with a digital layer of tools. We hope to benefit from this global community of do-ers by enhancing the connectivity between them and the spaces in which they work such as Fab Labs.</p>

        <p>The Poblenou Maker District aims to foster interaction within the local community and strengthen reindustrialization process-es in the urban fabric with added-value features, such as the use of cutting-edge technologies for local production, training workers to face new challenges in the workplace in the immediate future and fostering Industry 4.0. Based on an internation-al perspective of the “Fab City”, the construction of a new model for cities using the power of the Maker Movement and the global Fab-Lab network.</p>
