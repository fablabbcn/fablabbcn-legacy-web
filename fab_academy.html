		    	<h3>What is Fab Academy?<br>
			    	<small>How to Make (Almost) Anything</small>
		    	</h3>
		    	<br>
		    	<p>Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication program directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Fab Academy offers a 6 month program on digital fabrication, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs. The Fab Academy offers Certificates on relevant technical topics, and a Diploma aimed at vocational and technical training for employment and investment (along with assistance to its graduates in those areas). Fab Academy Certificates provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. Each requires, and is evaluated by, developing and documenting projects. They are periodically renewed to reflect best practices. Each Certificate typically requires one week. They are combined in the Diploma, which is roughly comparable to completing MIT’s rapid-prototyping course ‘How To Make (almost) Anything’. Progress is evaluated by skills and projects rather than time or credits.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During this 6 month program, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.</p><br>

				<h1><strong>FAB ACADEMY GLOBAL CLASSROOM</strong></h1>
				<p>Fab Academy runs in more than 70 Fab Labs, for more than 250 students per year in the largest campus of the world. It is directed by Neil Gershenfeld from MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Since 2009, lectures have been distributed weekly to the global Fab Academy classroom; supported locally in each Fab Lab through hands-on learning. Students will use technology such as 3D printing, laser cutting, programming and electronics to research and deliver one of twenty skill-based Certificates per week, in syndication with peers across the globe. Students will graduate from this global classroom at the annual gathering of the global Fab Lab network, FabX in the presence of Professor Neil Gershenfeld. Fab Academy is the premier course of the distributed education program, Academany, the Academy of Almost Anything.
				</p><br/>
				<p>Over ten years, Fab Lab Barcelona has become a global benchmark for the Fab Academy experience. Students come from every continent to study in Barcelona with the Future Learning Unit and experts from Fab Lab Barcelona. Future of Education specialist and Fab Academy Barcelona Alum Santi Fuentemilla leads the hands-on instruction the lab, supported by experts in digital fabrication, robotics, machine learning, coding and materials. Students in Barcelona study in a professional lab environment. In addition, the course is delivered in collaboration with students from the IAAC Master of Design for Emergent Futures which provides an opportunity to expand ones professional and personal experiences. Alumni of the program have used their future-skills to build leading roles in the global Fab Lab network, established their own design studios and become entrepreneurs in the innovation and social design fields.</p>

			    <h3>Learn to Turn Codes into Things</h3>
			    <br>
			    <p>Just as communications and computation went from analog to digital, resulting in PCs and the Internet, the digitization of fabrication is leading to personal fabricators that will allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere. The development of digital fabrication is based on creating codes that don’t just describe things, they are things, much as proteins are coded in molecular biology. This research roadmap is ultimately aiming at a Star Trek-style replicator, but prototype versions of these capabilities are already available in field fab labs.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p>At the Fab Academy, you will learn how to envision, prototype and document your ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools. We take a variety of code formats and turn them into physical objects.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p>The Fab Academy is a fast paced, hands-on learning experience where students plan and execute a new project each week. Each individual documents their progress for each project, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments.</p>
			    <br>
			    <h4>Students at the Fab Academy learn:</h4>
			    <br>
			    <p>- How to use a Fab Lab’s digital fabrication tools for rapid prototyping</p>
			    <br>
			    <ul>
				    <li>Epilog Mini Lasercutter</li>
			        <li>Roland MDX-20 Milling Machine</li>

			        <li>ShopBot</li>
			    </ul>
			    <br>
			    <p>- Electronics design and production by producing circuit boards using a variety of sensors and output devices.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p>- How to program AVR microcontrollers on the boards they have produced.</p>

			    <h3>How It Works</h3>
			    <br>
			    
			    <p>Each lab that participates in the Fab Academy program is part of a global Fab Lab / Fab Academy network. The local branches of the Fab Academy work with other participating Fab Labs and experts from around the wold via a distributed educational model where we pool our knowledge to provide a unique educational experience.</p>
			    <br>
			    <p>We view and participate in global lectures broadcast from MIT on Wednesdays at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST. The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester. In addition to the lectures, there are two lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects.</p>			    
			    <br>
			    <img src="{{sitebase.url}}/img/fab_academy/fab_academy_2.JPG" alt="Fab Academy"/>
			    <br><br>
			    <p>Fab Academy faculty who are leaders in their respective fields provide global video lectures, supervise academic content, and guide research. Hands-on instruction in the labs is provided by instructors who supervise and evaluate Certificates, develop and disseminate instructional material, and assist with projects.</p>
