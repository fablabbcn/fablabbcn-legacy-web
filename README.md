# fablabbcn-web
This is the repo for the [FabLabBCN website](https://fablabbcn.org)

## Info
* This page is hosted on GitHub Pages .
* Every git commit to the repository will automatically go to the live page (within a minute)
* GitHub Pages uses Jekyll
   * Jekyll has [Video Walkthroughs](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) - Watch them to learn the basics!


## Adding content to the site
* The easiest way to add/edit content on the site is to use GitHub directly.
* We are also trying out Forestry.io and CloudCannon to handle (abstract) adding content to the website.
* You need to be invited by the admin to either Forestry.io or CloudCannon to use it. They are great.
