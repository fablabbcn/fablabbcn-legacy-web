This is the repo for the [FabLabBCN legacy website](https://fablabbcn.github.io/fablabbcn-web/)

## Info
* This page is hosted on Github Pages .
* Every git commit to the repository will automatically go to the live page (within a minute)
* Github Pages uses Jekyll
   * Jekyll has [Video Walkthroughs](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) - Watch them to learn the basics!


## Adding content to the site
* The easiest way to add/edit content on the site is to use Github directly.
* We are also trying out Forestry.io and CloudCannon to handle (abstract) adding content to the website.
* You need to be invited by the admin to either Forestry.io or CloudCannon to use it.
