<p><strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> is an intensive six month program that teaches students to design, prototype and invent almost anything using digital fabrication tools and machines.<br/><br/>The course is directed by <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> from <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms</a></strong> and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: How to Make (Almost) Anything. Since 2001, they have been at the cutting edge of the global maker movement; enabling innovation and democratising the use of digital fabrication technology through the growing network of Fab Labs around the world.</p>

<br/>

<p style="font-size:18px;"><em>“Digital fabrication consists of much more than 3-d printing. It is an evolving suite of capabilities to turn data into things and things into data. Many years of research remain to complete this vision, but the revolution is already well under way.”<br/>Neil Gershenfeld</em></p>

<br/>

<p>The Fab Academy brings together a multi-disciplinary and hands-on learning experience that can be taken in any number of participating Fab Labs around the world. At it’s core, Fab Academy empowers students to learn by doing, inspires them to make stuff locally, and to become active participants in sustainable cities and communities.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> is a <strong>Digital Fabrication</strong> program directed by <strong>Neil Gershenfeld</strong> of <strong><a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course</a></strong>, <strong>MAS 863</strong>: <strong>How to Make (Almost) Anything</strong>.</p><br>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> offers a <strong>6 month program on digital fabrication</strong>, and it could be taken in any of the participating labs. The <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a></strong> offers <strong>Certificates</strong> on relevant technical topics, and a <strong>Diploma</strong> aimed at vocational and technical training for employment and investment (along with assistance to its graduates in those areas). <strong><a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a> Certificates</strong> provide familiarity with technical options and capabilities, hands-on experience, and direction for further study. Each requires, and is evaluated by, developing and documenting projects. They are periodically renewed to reflect best practices. Each Certificate typically requires one week. They are combined in the Diploma, which is roughly comparable to completing MIT’s rapid-prototyping course <strong>‘How To Make (almost) Anything’</strong>. Progress is evaluated by skills and projects rather than time or credits.</p><br>
<p><strong>During this 6 month program, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.</strong></p><br>

<p><strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/index.html" target="blank">Fab Lab Barcelona</a></strong> was the first Fab Lab to open in the EU back in 2007, and this year celebrates ten years of innovation, collaboration and invention.</p> 

<br/>

<p>Based in the heart of the <strong><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/q8L1CRTutDs" target="blank">vibrant Poblenou district</a></strong>, the Fab Lab Barcelona is also a bustling maker community and incubation hub. The Fab Lab is located within the Institute for <strong><a href="https://iaac.net/">Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC)</a></strong>, where architecture students come from all over the world, adding an exciting international flavour to the mix. <br/><br/> Fab Lab Barcelona has also been instrumental in exciting new research projects such as <strong><a href="https://fablabbcn.org/0000/01/06/smart-citizen.html" target="blank">Smart Citizen</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://fab.city/" target="blank">Fab City</a></strong>, among others which aim to use citizen data and local manufacturing to transform the cities of the future. To this end, Poblenou offers an ideal urban space to experiment with new ideas and innovation.</p>

<br/>

<p>The Fab Lab Barcelona works in tandem with the <strong><a href="http://greenfablab.org/" target="blank">Green Fab Lab</a></strong>, a digital fabrication space dedicated to innovation in agro-ecology, forestry and conservation. Located in Valldaura on the hills above Barcelona, the Green Fab Lab offers an opportunity to learn directly from nature in order to develop a more sustainable and ecological solutions for 21st-century cities.</p> 

<br/>
