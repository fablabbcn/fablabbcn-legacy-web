## HELP

### What is Github?
Github is a a place where we **store data**, mainly text based (code and documentation). It _can_ also store images and videos but it is not optimized for that.

Github uses a technology called **git**, a **version control** technology to help keep history of changes to text.

Git **records** every **change** you make to a text, allowing you do **undo everything**, and see who changed what line at what time and why.

Git uses the term **commit** for changes. It is similar to using the **Save button** in other programs.


### Why should we add our users here?
By having all our users on Github, we can manage them into multiple **Teams**.

Each Team can have access to repositories, and be allowed to **login to websites**. 

**Example:** All members of the team called **Employees** can log into our [Grafana monitoring](https://grafana.fab.city) service by clicking the 'Sign in with Github' button. (No need to create additional login / password.)

We could use this for more services to make user management easier.


### How to edit files on Github

1. Make sure you have selected the correct file by clicking it in the repository
2. Click the **pencil** (edit) button on the right :pencil:

3. Make your changes 
4. Click the green **Commit Changes** button :heavy_check_mark:


### How do I make changes to our main website fablabbcn.org
* Our [main website](https://fablabbcn.org) is 100% open with all it's content on [Github](https://github.com/fablabbcn/fablabbcn-web)
* We host our page on Github Pages 
   * Every `git` commit to the repository will automatically go to the live page (within a minute)
* Github Pages use a Static Website generator called Jekyll
   * Jekyll has [Video Walkthroughs](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/) - Watch them to learn the basics!
* We are also trying out [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) and CloudCannon to handle (abstract) adding content to the website
